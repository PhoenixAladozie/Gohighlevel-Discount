## Understanding GoHighLevel’s AI Pricing Model

GoHighLevel’s AI features are not free; they are available as add-ons or bundled with higher subscription tiers. Here’s how the pricing typically works:

- **Base Subscription:** You pay a monthly fee for the core platform. AI features are often not included in the lowest tier.
- **AI Add-Ons:** Advanced tools—like chatbots, predictive analytics, or AI content generation—may cost extra. This can be a flat monthly fee, or usage-based (e.g., per chatbot interaction or per word generated).
- **Usage-Based Fees:** Some features are billed according to how much you use them, so costs can vary month-to-month.

**For skeptical agencies:**  
It’s important to review your actual needs and compare the costs of GoHighLevel’s AI modules versus manual labor or other software solutions. Many agencies find that automating repetitive tasks pays for itself over time, but it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution.
